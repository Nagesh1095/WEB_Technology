   	<center><h1><b>DIGITAL FUEL INDICATION SYSTEM</b></h1></center>
	<hr>
	<center><h2><b>-:INTRODUCTION:-</b></h2></center>
	<p>In this 21st century almost everything has become digital, if the fuel indicators in the vehicles is
additionally made advanced, we can determine the correct quantity of fuel available in the fuel
tank. Hence, this system will be indicating the amount of fuel in the tank in milliliters. The
indication of fuel will be in numerical digits (ex: - 100ml, 200ml and 1000ml). This system mainly
focuses about the indication of fuel level in car, trucks or diesel occupied tanks. This project
allows us to get rid of issues like fuel theft at fuel stations, fuel adulteration and keeps us from
getting into circumstances where we may get into inconvenient situations due to unspecified level
of fuel. Current systems contain the fuel indication mechanism for the automobiles which are
computerized yet they don't show the correct amount of fuel which is available in the tank i.e.
they demonstrate the measure of fuel in as bars and not in numbers or digits like liters or Milliliter.
So, this issue is considered for our work of building up the digital (numeric) fuel indication
mechanism for automobiles which indicates correct measure of fuel in Milliliters (ml).

    <center><h2>-:LITERATURE SURVEY:-</h2></center>
	<p>Mr. Vaibhav N. Ghenand et.al [1] done the experiment on “DIGITAL FUEL INDICATION
SYSTEM” in their study they concluded that, two Ultrasonic sensors detect the exact quantity of
fuel available in fuel tank along with this the gas sensor will detect the quality of fuel being filled
in tank. Thus, these two important factors of quality and quantity from customer’s point of view
are determined. Hence this project with accurate measurements will help us avoid the major issues
of fuel fraud being carried out at fuel stations and it will also help us get the idea about the fuel
adulteration.
Mr. Kunal D. Dhande et.al [2] have investigated on “FUEL LEVEL MESUREMENTS
TECHNIQUES: A SYSTEMSTIC SURVEY” they concluded that The existing traditional and
the microcontroller based float type measurement techniques are far from exact and are on the
conservative, however the microcontroller based technique is more accurate compared to the
traditional technique but still lacks accuracy due to fuel sloshing in the tank unless float sensor is
calibrated with respect to the size and curves of the tank. So, by using any one of the level
measuring sensors described above will most likely be more accurate, more reliable, and cheaper
than other analog meters, and will allow for added features that benefit both the customer. In the
near future, the different vehicle company manufacturers will implement this kind of fuel system
which also provides security for the vehicle owners. Not only will the measurement be more
accurate, but the consumers also will not be cheated for their hard-earned money.

    <h3>-:OBJECTIVES:-</h3>
	<p>
	• To determine the correct quantity of fuel available in the fuel tank of vehicles.<br>
	• To indicate the amount of fuel in the tank in milliliters.<br>
	• To know about parameters that indicates the volume of fuel in tank available for driving
	the automobile with the more precision compare to the existing system.<br>
	• To reduce the corruption.<br>
	• To calculate and verify the paid amount of fuel was delivered to the vehicle or not.<br>
	• To allows us to get rid of issues like fuel theft at fuel stations and fuel adulterations.<br>
	• To demonstrate the measure of fuel in as bars and not in numbers or digits like liters or
	milliliters.<br>
	• To monitor vehicle by sitting in home itself.<br>
